## Hello world 3.0

<!--
**cryptozoide/cryptozoide** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

-->
- 🔭 I'm currently working on learning everything I missed out on ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to live and how to leave something that might be useful to someone someday
- 🤔  I'm looking for help to correct my mistakes, not in life, but in my code 乁<(•◡•)>ㄏ
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm not a developer, just a curious tinkerer with too many ideas and projects that, for the most part, never saw the light of day or were abandoned for various reasons.

But this time it's different. This project is very close to my heart (as are all the others ^^), and at this point in my life, it was THE project not to be missed.

I confess, somewhat shamefully, that without AIs and the like, I might have given up. Admittedly, they can be perfected and are very limited (for the time being), but for someone like me, it's almost a miracle to publish a project like this thanks to them.

From now on, I see them more as assistants than as “intelligences”.

Basically, Open Source, my lifelong passion, has brought me this far.

I don't know how long this project will go on. If, by chance, it is no longer active when you read these lines, I encourage you to pick up the torch and not let it die out.

Continuing to share this passion and inspire others is essential. Every contribution, no matter how small, fuels the flame of innovation. Even if this project comes to an end, the spirit of Open Source lives on in each and every one of us.

PS: I'm not fluent in English ❪╹﹏╹❫
